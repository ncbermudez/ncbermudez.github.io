Welcome! I am first year PhD Student in Humanities and Social Sciences of Medicine and Health at [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/unil/en/home.html). I am currently affiliated at Universidad de los Andes, Colombia, as Research Assisstant for the mental health and economic track of the research project [Improving Adolescent Mental Health by Tackling the Impact of Poverty – ALIVE](https://www.alive4mentalhealth.org/). My research interests lie in the fields of gender inequalities, public health, and human capital accumulation across the lifespan. In my research, I use quantitative methods, household panel data, and cross-sectional surveys, with a special emphasis on causal designs. 

I also have research and policy experience working as a consultant for the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en), [International Finance Corporation/World Bank](https://www.ifc.org/en/home), and [Pan-American Health Organization/World Health Organization](https://www.paho.org/en) on public health, social protection, and digital health transformation in multilateral organizations in the United States, and emerging countries such as Colombia, Haiti, Brazil, and Kenia. 

I hold a Master's degree in Public Policy from Universidad de los Andes in Colombia. My master dissertation, [_Factors Associated with the Quality of School Management Practices: An Empirical Analysis for Colombia_](https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/server/api/core/bitstreams/b398074a-8434-4e3a-9fc4-08b78ef6d081/content), assessed the school management practices and processes in Colombian public schools. Main findings show that the years of principal tenure in the same school and economic incentives provided by laws are positively associated with school management practices and processes, while the number of venues play in a negative way.
